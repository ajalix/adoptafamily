Adopt A Family BuildWithChrist Event

## Overview
The Adopt A Family event is a collaborative effort to streamline and automate the process of matching families in need with sponsors during the holiday season. This initiative aims to reduce the manual workload for organizers and improve the efficiency of the adoption process.

## Process Flow

### Current Process
The current process involves several manual steps:

1. **Intake**: Families in need are interviewed to collect their wish lists and demographic information. This is done in person to ensure detailed and accurate information.
2. **Processing and Storage**: The collected information is manually entered into spreadsheets and stored in Google Drive. Each family's wish list is saved as an individual Word document.
3. **Matching**: Families are matched with sponsors based on their preferences and the sponsors' capabilities. This involves a lot of manual coordination and communication.
4. **Communication and Logistics**: Sponsors are sent standardized emails with the wish lists and other relevant information. This step is labor-intensive and involves a lot of copy-pasting and attaching files.
5. **Distribution**: Finally, the gifts are distributed to the families.
